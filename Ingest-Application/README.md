# Ingest Application

## Purpose

The Illvuium Overworld Ingest Application was built with the goal of creating an efficient format to intake data while running around the overworld.

### Application Structure

The GUI was written with the customtkinter package in the python file "ingest.py". Interacting with the buttons, entry boxes, and switches will intake the data into a dictionary (custom data structure within the "data.py" file). The dictionary can be reset or saved into a locally stored json file using the "save" and "reset" buttons incorporated in the initial window.

### Result

These files were compiled into an .exe application presented in the output folder.
